# 2d customizable chess sandbox

The goal is to create a chess sandbox, where you can freely edit chess pieces, boards and rules and than play games against friends or people around the world. Project is in its beginning stage - nothing is implemented :). I need to figure out how to do shit or im fucked. For now the main focus will be on developing frontend for sandbox and actually being able to play chess.

# customizable rules:

## chessboard shape and size:

- Limit: all boards MUST be composed from squares, that are either white, black or special(potentially in the future for example teleportation squares)
- freely delete or add squares
- create default chess boards of different sizes (8x8,9x9,20x20)

## figures:

- edit starting positions
- create your own figures with custom move rules

## fundamental rules:

- edit fundamental rules like board visibility, victory condition or number of players - delayed until I have working earlier features

# Limits:

- all fields must be squares
- all pieces must cover one field
